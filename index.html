        <h3>Hi</h3>
            <div class="line"></div>
    <p>One of my farorite hobbies is coding. I have been learning in BYJU'S FutureSchool. I am 11 years old and I am in 6th grade. I like coding because if you learn to code you can make many wonderful apps and webpages. There are also many jobs available that include coding so I will have many options to choose from when I grow up. When I grow up I want to be a scientist and to be a scientist you need to learn to code, but even if I don't become a scientist I can still do other things that include coding.</p>
